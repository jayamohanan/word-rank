# Board Mode Implementation

## Overview
A new interactive game mode has been added to your Word Rank game! Board Mode combines word frequency guessing with a "clear the board" mechanic, making the game more engaging and puzzle-like.

#### How to Play
1. **First Pick**: Click any word on the board ‚Üí it moves to "Slot 1" (Higher Rank)
2. **Second Pick**: Click another word ‚Üí it moves to "Slot 2" (Lower Rank)
3. **Validation**:
   - ‚úÖ **Valid Pair**: If first word has higher rank (lower number) than second word ‚Üí both words are cleared from the board
   - ‚ùå **Invalid Pair**: If order is wrong ‚Üí both words return to the board

#### Win Condition
Clear all 15 pairs (30 words total) from the board!

### 4. Visual Feedback

- **Correct pairs**: Green checkmark message + sound effect
